\begin{frame}[t]{Which problems are we solving?}
\textbf{A tangle of unfamiliar concepts:}
    \pause
\begin{itemize}
    \item you don’t know where to start
    \pause
    \item explanations are \emph{ignotum per ignotum} (the unknown explained by another unknown), often circular
    \pause
    \item every individual case is different — there is no single template or universal formula
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Selected technologies and data analysis methods}
\textbf{We use modern tools that let us address each of these challenges!}
    \pause
\begin{itemize}
  \item Historical data (inflation, GDP growth, sector wages) used as a reference context.
  \pause
  \item Machine‑learning models that classify occupation/industry and estimate the earnings trajectory.
  \pause
  \item Large language models (LLMs) with RAG — verifying market rates and the freshness of data.
\end{itemize}
